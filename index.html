<h1>CE Bergin's Portfolio </h1>
<h3>(Under Development, but feel free to look around. The Social Media Support Application Project is the most fleshed out right now)</h3>

<p>Welcome, this is my Portfolio site designed to show off what I've learned in the last two years of education at Camosun College. </p>

<p> I feel my education has given me a great head start in multiple fields. Courses in Java have left me with a strong foundation for all forms of programming. The multiple System Administration classes have shown me how to work and problem solve in Windows and Linux based Operating Systems. I have experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript and React (as well as the quick Jekyll page). I've used both Oracle and MongoDB Databases and understand their separate values. In addition my capstone project had a large focus on technical writing and documentation. </p>
<p> For some images and code snippets of my projects, please check out my Projects page.</p>
