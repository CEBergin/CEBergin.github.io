    <p id="aboutme">
      As a recent graduate of Camosun College's Information and Computer Systems Technology program I’ve learned multiple
     relevant skills for a future career in the tech industry. I'm currently looking for an entry level position in the Software Industry.

     <br>
      I feel my education has given me a great head start in multiple fields.
      Courses in Java have left me with a strong foundation for all forms of programming.
       The multiple System Administration classes have shown me how to work and problem solve
        in Windows and Linux based Operating Systems.
         While I don’t intend to be a web designer I still put in effort to understand and 
         use HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. 
       I've used both Oracle and MongoDB Databases and understand their seperate values. In addition I've had a lot of practice with technical writing.<br>
