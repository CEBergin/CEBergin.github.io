    <p id ="title">First Year Information and Computer Systems Student</p> </p>



<p id="aboutme">
    As a first year student studying Information and Computer Systems I’ve learned multiple
     relevant skills for a future career in the tech industry.
      Courses in Java have left me with a strong foundation for all forms of programming.
       The multiple System Administration classes have shown me how to work and problem solve
        in Windows and Linux based Operating Systems.
         While I don’t intend to be a web designer I still put in effort to understand and 
         use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
       I’ve even learned a little bit of MySQL. <br>
<br>
So while at this stage of my education I’m not ready for the business world, I am ready to use these skills to work on more projects, and develop my talents.
