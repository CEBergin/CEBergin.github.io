Hi, I'm Cody Bergin, I'm a recent graduate of Camosun College's Information and Computer Systems Technology program looking for working Victoria BC. 

My interests in Software Development lend towards the Back-End. I enjoy working with, building or maintaining databases. I like setting up APIs or serving data as requested. 

This means I'm also happy gathering requirements, sitting down with clients and/or business stakeholders and figuring exactly what they need or want before mapping out a plan to action.

Of course while I may prefer a role as a back-end developer, until I have more professional experience I'd be happy to try anything in the tech industry just to see what it's like.
